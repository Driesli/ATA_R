# ATA_R
Make ATA using MILP easyR

This will become an R package that makes it easier to transform and ATA problem into a MILP model that can be solved by a solver. 
In the first phase, the focus lies on the assembly of parallel linear tests, using GUROBI.

The aim is that constraints (and the objective) can be easily constructed and combined into a MILP model.
